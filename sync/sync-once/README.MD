# To `sync.Once`...or twice

## Why would I need to re-run `sync.Once`? 

In certain situations it might be required to reset the function passed to `Do(f func())`. This could happen if a temporary (non-fatal) error has occurred, or to react to a change in the environment. 

Is that a good idea? Read [here](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25955) what the Go engineers have to say.
